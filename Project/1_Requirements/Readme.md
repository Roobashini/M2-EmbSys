	Introduction:
     Flooding is one of the globeâ€Ÿs most common natural disasters. Although wecan estimate rainfall or track cyclone paths with great precision using satellite images, having real-time monitored data such as flow, precipitation level, or water level is critical for making smart decisions regarding the actions that must be taken to prevent flooding. Flood damage costs are highly correlated with the amount of warning time provided prior to a flood event, making flood monitoring and forecasting vital to limiting flood damagecosts.
     While the number of rainy days has reduced, intense rain events involving flash floods have become more common. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a new type of
 highly dynamic condition that may be used for a variety of purposes, including military frameworks, living space inspection, precision horticulture, and building monitoring.
     To display and assess the surge over a stream, the Time Flood Monitoring System (RTFMS) is employed. The fundamental cause of flood is the hydrological condition of heavy rain fall and enormous water flow. A contributing reason is the metrological situation, which includes poor drainage, excessive siltation in rivers, embankment breaching, and floodwater spilling over them. Flooding conditions are influenced by geographical factors such as water flows from neighboring states, river flows across states, and topographical conditions to some extent. Because of the availability of emergency systems in modern countries such as the United States and Japan, flooding is considerably reduced and has little impact.
     The "Early Flood Detection & Avoidance System" is a smart system that monitors a variety of natural occurrences in order to predict floods and prepare for them caution and reduce flood damage. Natural disasters such as flooding and other natural disasters can be severe, causing property damage and even death. The system identifies floods by analysing a variety of natural parameters in order to eliminate or mitigate the flood's impacts. The obtained data may be accessed by government officials from anywhere using IoT because the system is Wi-Fi enabled. The system monitors a variety of natural elements, including rainfall, water level, and flow rate, to detect a flood. The system is made up of numerous sensors that collect data on individual characteristics in order to collect data on the natural components described above. Water level and water flow sensors are installed at various sites across the river and dam, collecting data on water level and water flow from the dam and rivers. The occurrence of floods is predicted based on this information. The main purpose of this project is to develop and build a flood monitoring and detection system based on the internet of things. The project's goal is to create an early flood detection system that will automatically identify floods and provide data to the Local Government Unit and citizens. The precise goals of the project include detecting the current level of water in rivers at various locations, predicting river water levels, warning residents about floods, and updating government officials about the situation of the floods, and informing government officials about the situation.
